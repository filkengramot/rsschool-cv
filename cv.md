## Something about myself

I mainly work as an HR Analyst, analyzing and compiling dashboards of what is happening with our employees, such as people fired and hired, employee turnover, compensation, benefits and salary, etc. I also work with recruitment, training center helping to streamline their reporting. I am compiling technical specifications for the development of new reports in a popular program in Russia based on 1C type 1C: Enterprise. Also I do ad-hoc reports, and whatever else my boss desires to analyze :)
I love to optimize work procedures and routine. Love when machine doing boring things while people solve creative problems and develops themselves.
